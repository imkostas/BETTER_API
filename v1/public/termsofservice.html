				<b> Better Terms of Service</b></h1>
				<p>
				Better Inc. (“Better”) acts as an intermediary to provide Users (as defined below) with information and a means to obtain a parking spot offered by other Users through the use of an application supplied by Better and downloaded and installed by you on your Android or iOS mobile device (the “Better Platform”).  The services provided by Better through the Better Platform or the Site shall be the “Services.”
				</p>
				<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
				<p>These terms of service (the “Terms of Service”) set forth the terms and conditions under which Better provides you with access to the Better Platform, the Services and the Better website located at www.organicparking.com (the “Site”).
				</p>  
				<p>Throughout these Terms of Service, the words “We,” “Us,” and “Our” refer to Better and its corporate affiliates and the words “You” and “Your” refer to the individual using the Better Platform and/or Services and/or visiting the Site.  You must agree with and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in these Terms of Service before You access the Site or the Better Platform or use any of the Services.  By accessing the Site or using the Better Platform or any of the Services, You become a participant of the Better Platform and a user of Services (“User”) and You agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and Better’s <a href="privacyPolicy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”)</a>  with respect to Your use of the Better Platform, the Site and the Services.
				</p>
				<p>
				If You do not agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service, You may not use or access the Site the Better Platform or the Services. We may amend these Terms of Service at any time by posting the amended terms on the Better Platform or the Site. 
				</p>
				<h2>Services</h2>
				<p>
				The Better Platform provides a means to enable persons seeking a parking spot at a specific destination (a “Seeker”) to exchange information and contact persons already parked in, or having access to, a parking spot in such desired destinations (a “Poster”).  The Better Platform enables a Seeker and a Poster to communicate with and transact with each other. 
				</p>
				<p>Better does not post parking spots, and Better is not an owner of parking spots.  It is up to the Poster to decide, in Poster’s sole discretion, whether or not to offer a parking spot to a Seeker contacted through the Better Platform, and it is up the Seeker to decide, in Seeker’s sole discretion, whether or not to accept a parking spot from any Poster through the Better Platform.  Better only acts as an intermediary between the Poster and the Seeker, and Better has no responsibility or liability of any kind for any parking spot services voluntarily provided to or by any User by a Poster.
				</p>
				<p>All transactions conducted through the Better Platform shall be subject to all local laws and ordinances, including but not limited to neighborhood parking restrictions and other parking limitations.  Seeker acknowledges that certain parking spots offered by Poster may be subject to certain parking restrictions, including but not limited to residential limitations, and Seeker may only purchase a spot for which Seeker is entitled to park and for which Seeker possesses any requisite permits or applications.  Seeker agrees that by purchasing a spot from a Poster that such purchase is subject to all local laws and ordinances and that Seeker shall remain solely responsible for any ticket expenses, meter fares or other fees arising out of or related to Seeker’s use of such parking spot. 
				</p>
				<h2>Marketplace
				</h2>
				<p>Each User will be required to provide such User’s credit card and bank account information, which is collected by Better, but the portion of the Better Platform where such credit card information is entered is operated and controlled by Braintree, Inc., which handles Better Platform’s payment processing.  Each User’s credit card will be charged a specific amount upon creation of such User’s account which amount will be stored by Better in the User account (a “Marketplace”).  When Seeker purchases a parking spot through the Better Platform, the Offer (as defined below) will be deducted from such Seeker’s credit card or bank account using the Marketplace. 
				</p>


				<h2>Offers</h2>
				<p>As a Poster, You may wish to post a parking spot on the Better Platform for a suggested amount determined by You at Your sole discretion. 
				</p>
				<p>As a Seeker, You may elect to communicate with a Poster through the Better Platform and to make an offer to purchase Poster’s posted parking spot at a price no less than such Poster’s suggested price (the “Offer”).  The decision whether to contact any Poster or purchase any parking spot for a Offer is at Your sole discretion.  If You contact Poster to purchase a parking spot and based on Your communication the Poster communicates with You and accepts Your offer, You will use the Better Platform to confirm the transaction.  Upon Your confirmation of the transaction, You will be charged the Offer.
				</p>  
				<p>Better uses Braintree, a division of PayPal, Inc. (Braintree) for payment processing. In order for you to use Braintree's payment processing services, you must read and agree to the Commercial Entity User Agreement (CEA) available at <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal/cea-wells" target="_blank">https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal/cea-wells</a> and the Payment Services Agreement available at <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal/gateway-agreement" target="_blank">https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal/gateway-agreement</a>. By accepting this Agreement, you agree: (a) that you have downloaded or printed the CEA, and (b) that you have reviewed and agree to the CEA. If you have questions regarding the CEA or the PSA, please contact Braintree at 877.434.2894.
				</p>
				<p>Better does not receive any fees.  However, Better uses Braintree Inc., an online payment system who charges a fee of 2.9% + 30 cents (the “Service Fee”) of each Offer that a Seeker sends to a Poster.  If a Seeker gets a spot from a Poster, the Offer is charged immediately upon Seeker’s confirmation of the transaction.  The Offer amount is deducted from Your Bank Account and transferred (less the Service Fee) to such Poster’s Bank Account]. 
				</p>

				<p>Better, at its sole discretion, may make available promotional offers with different features to any of Our Users.  These promotional offers, unless made to You, shall have no bearing whatsoever on Your offer or contract with a Poster.  Better may change its Service Fee as We deem necessary for Our business.  We encourage You to check these Terms of Service periodically for the latest Service Fee.
				</p>
				<p>Better has the right to monitor and collect information about each User’s transactions, including but not limited to whether each Seeker or Poster cancels transactions.  Each User will receive a “strike” for each cancellation by such User.  In addition to Better’s rights set forth herein, in the event that a User receives three strikes, Better will provide such User with a warning, and if such User receives a fourth strike, Better shall have the right to immediately terminate such Seeker or Poster’s access to the Better Platform, Site and Services.
				</p>


				<h2>License Grant</h2> 
				<p>Contingent upon Your compliance with these Terms of Service, Better hereby grants to You a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive, non-assignable, revocable license to download and install one copy of the Better Platform on a single Android or iOS run device that You own or control solely for Your own personal use and, with respect to an iOS device, solely as permitted by the terms applicable to Apple devices as set forth in these Terms of Service (the “Apple Terms”).  This license does not allow You to use the Better Platform on any device that You do not own or control, and You may not distribute or make the Better Platform available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time.  You may not rent, lease, lend, post, redistribute or sublicense the Better Platform.  You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this license and the Apple Terms), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Better Platform, any updates, or any part thereof.  Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of Better and its licensors.  The terms of the license will govern any upgrade provided by Better, in Better’s sole discretion, that replace and/or supplement the Better Platform, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.
				</p>

				<p>You will be required to provide Us with certain information such as name, vehicle model, make, and color to register an account as a User of the Better Platform and hereby consent to Us using such information in connection with the Services in accordance with <a href="privacyPolicy.html" target="_blank">Our Privacy Policy.</a>  You shall be the sole authorized user of Your account and You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any password provided by You or Better for accessing the Services.  You are solely and fully responsible for all activities that occur under Your password or account.

				</p>

				<p>When You use the Better Platform, You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information as prompted by Our registration form and to maintain and timely update Your information to keep it accurate, current and complete at all times while using the Services.  You agree that We and other people of the public may rely on the information You provide as accurate, current and complete.

As a result, and also as a result of Our network architecture and business practices and the nature of electronic communications, even communications that seem to be intrastate in nature can result in the transmission of interstate communications regardless of where You are physically located at the time of transmission.  Accordingly, by agreeing to these Terms of Service, You acknowledge that use of the Better Platform, Site and/or Services may result in interstate data transmissions.
