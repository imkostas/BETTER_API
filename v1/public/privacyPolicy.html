				<b>Privacy Policy</b></h1>
				<p>
				Better, Inc. (“Better,” “we” “us” or “our”) is dedicated to protecting your privacy.  The “Better Platform” is composed of our web site, our mobile application and certain tracking, recommendation and transaction services.  This Privacy Policy governs your use of the Better Platform and any features, widgets, plug-ins, applications, content, downloads or other services that we own or control and make available or otherwise posts a link to this Privacy Policy.  By accessing or using the Better Platform, or any component thereof, you consent to the use of your Personal Information (defined below) as described in this Privacy Policy.  If you are unwilling to consent to our collection and use of your Personal Information as described in this Policy, and to accept the terms in the <a href="index.html#termsbtn">Terms of Service</a> , you should not access or use the Better Platform.  The statements in this Privacy Policy only apply to our privacy practices on the Better Platform and do not apply to any third parties that may independently interact with the Better Platform.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to our data collection activities offline or otherwise outside of the Better Platform (unless otherwise stated below).
				</p>
				<h2>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>
				<p>	In connection with our operation of the Better Platform and your use of the services, from time to time we collect, retain and utilize certain categories of information such as: (i) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, such as your first and last name, e-mail address, mailing address, mobile telephone number, payment information (including credit card information), vehicle make, model and license number, geolocation and demographic information such as your gender, age, zip code, username, password, and  birth date.  We may collection this information through various forms and in various places on the Better Platform, including account registration forms, contact us forms, transaction pages or when you otherwise interact with the Better Platform. Personal Information is divided into two categories: 1) "transaction information," which consists of parking spot transaction information and one-on-one communications between you and other users of the Better Platform; and 2) "public information," which consists of all other Personal Information.  The Better Platform also collects credit card and related billing information, but the portion of the Better Platform where credit card information is entered is operated and controlled by Stripe, Inc., which handles the Better Platform’s payment processing.  Better does not review your credit card information when you engage in a transaction although we do know the amount that is charged to your credit card for use with the Better Platform.  
In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our the Better Platform, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect or store certain information when you visit or interact with the Better Platform (“Usage Information”).  This Usage Information may include the browser that you are using and the time of day, among other information.  This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your mobile phone, tablet, or personal computer (a “Device”) when you visit or interact with the Better Platform. 
				</p>
				<p>Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you.  To the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information. 
				</p>
				<p>This Usage Information may include:
				</p>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>your IP address, UDID or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Better Platform, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;
					</li>
					<li>your Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);
					</li>
					<li>the areas within the Better Platform that you visit and your activities and transaction history, including remembering you and your preferences;
					<li>our Device location;
					</li>
					<li>your Device characteristics; and
					</li>
					<li>certain other Device data, including the time of day, among other information.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>In addition, tracking information is collected as you navigate through the Better Platform, including, but not limited to geographic areas of you and/or your vehicle. 
				</p>
				<p>We may use various methods and technologies to collect or store Usage Information (“Tracking Technologies”).  Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device.  A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):
				</p>
				<p>Cookies.  A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Better Platform.  A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage.  Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in.  Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings.  Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard.  Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies.  For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe’s web site www.adobe.com.  Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of the Better Platform may not function properly, and that when you revisit the Better Platform your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
				</p>
				<p>Web Beacons.  Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in the Better Platform’s pages and messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Better Platform, to monitor how users navigate the Better Platform, to count how many messages that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
				</p> 
				<p>Embedded Scripts.  An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Better Platform, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Better Platform, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
				</p>
				<p>We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:
				</p>
				<p>Strictly Necessary.  We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and access the Better Platform, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of the parking transactions functionality.
				</p>
				<p>Performance Related.  We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are useful in order to assess the performance of the Better Platform, including as part of our analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, products or services offered through the Better Platform.
Functionality Related.  We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are required to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing the Better Platform, including identifying you when you sign in or keeping track of your specified preferences.
There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Better Platform.  Further, third parties may use Tracking Technologies with the Better Platform.  We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them.  You consent, however, to potentially encountering third-party Tracking Technologies in connection you’re your use of the Better Platform and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties.  
The Better Platform may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Better Platform and your account on a third-party web site, application or platform.  The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to us.  For example, when you register with us, you may have an option to use your Facebook, Google or other account information provided by a third-party site or application to facilitate the registration and log-in or transaction process on the Better Platform, or otherwise link accounts.  If we offer and you choose to use this functionality to access the Better Platform, the third-party site or application may send Personal Information about you to us.  If so, we will then treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, since we are collecting it as a result of your accessing of and interacting with the Better Platform.  In addition, we may provide third-party sites’ interfaces or links on the Better Platform to facilitate your sending a communication from the Better Platform.  These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’ practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy.  We may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties.  Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices.  You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on the Better Platform.
				</p>
				<h2>How We Use Personal Information
				</h2>
				<p>We may use your Personal Information and Usage Information that is subject to this Privacy Policy: (1) to provide you with information or services or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive including to send emails, text messages and correspondence with other users, or to provide you with confirmation e-mails, text messages, offers or promotional materials on behalf of us or third parties; (2) to enable you to participate in a variety of the Better Platform features, including sending transaction information to you from other users and vice versa, and to contact you and others to suggest potential transaction opportunities; (3) to process your registration with the Better Platform, including verifying your information is active and valid; (4) to improve the Better Platform or our other products and services, to customize your experience on the Better Platform, or to serve you specific content that is relevant to you; (5) to contact you with regard to your use of the Better Platform and, in our discretion, changes to the Better Platform or our policies; (6) for internal business purposes such as troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement; and (7) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.  In some cases, communications made to you by us may also contain commercial messages, such as banner ads and special offers.
				</p>
				<p>We may access, use, preserve, transfer or disclose your information (including Personal Information), including disclosure to third parties: (i) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoenas, governmental requests or legal process if in our good faith opinion such is required or permitted by law; (ii) to protect and/or defend the Better Platform’s Terms of Service or other applicable policies applicable, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (iii) to protect the safety, rights, property or security of the Better Platform, other users, or any third party; and/or (iv) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
				</p>  
				<p>Further, we cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.  Thus, we may use IP address or other Device Identifiers, to identify users and may do so in cooperation with third parties such as copyright owners, internet service providers, wireless service providers and/or law enforcement agencies, including disclosing such information to third parties, all in our discretion.  Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.
				</p>
				<p>Further, we may transfer Personal Information or Usage Information to third-party vendors who act for us for further processing in accordance with the purposes for which the information was originally collected, or for purposes to which you have subsequently consented.  For example, sometimes a third-party vendor may have access to your Personal Information or Usage Information in order to support our information technology or to help obtain, compile and manage the information for us.  As mentioned above, Stripe, Inc. receives your credit card and related billing information when you enter into a transaction using the Better Platform.
				</p> 
				<p>We may use certain demographic Personal Information to enable other users to search your profile on the Better Platform, to locate your vehicle, to determine whether your transaction offer meets other user's requirements, and to communicate with you.  We may also share such information with advertisers.  Our sharing of certain demographic information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., we do not tell advertisers which particular Better users are members of which demographic groups), subject to the rest of this Privacy Policy.
				</p>
				<p>We may also use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements on and off of the Better Platform and may use third-party analytics and other service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of the Better Platform and viewing of ads and of our content.  Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits and activities across the Internet and mobile media (“Behavioral Ads”).  In addition, we may serve ads on our Better Platform based on your Usage Information from your activities on the Better Platform (“Contextual Ads”).  Behavioral Ads and Contextual Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested.  If you object to Contextual Ads, do not use the Better Platform.  If you object to Behavioral Ads, you can learn more about how you may be able to limit Behavioral Ads by visiting htttp://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp. [Link to site].
				</p>
				<p>Our third-party ad network and exchange providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies (including Flash cookies), web beacons and other Tracking Technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral Usage Information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier.  These third-party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you.  You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations.  Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. 
				</p> 
				<p>Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even if they are used to serve our ads or interact with the Better Platform.  Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties or the use of the information that such third parties collect.  The relevant third party’s terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices.  We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.
				</p>
				<p>With respect to geolocation data we track through your Device, we use that geolocation information for various purposes – including (but not limited to) enabling you to find parking spots in your area that are close to your location, for you to set up your transaction with a poster of a parking space so the poster of a parking space is able to identify your vehicle and vice versa, and to allow you (if you choose through any features we may provide) to share this information with other people.  Except as otherwise permitted in this Privacy Policy, we will not share this information with third parties for any purpose and will only use this information for the sole purpose of providing you with the ability to request and post parking spaces via the Better Platform. You may at any time no longer allow the Better Platform to use your location by turning this feature off at the Device level, provided that doing so will mean you will be unable to use many features of the Better Platform.
				</p> 
				<p>We may also provide some of your Personal Information (such as your first name and your photo, if you have chosen to upload your photo to your profile) to the poster or seeker of your parking space transaction so that such user may locate you and know that you are the person he or she transacted with.
				</p> 
				<p>By purchasing, or registering or making reservations for, products or services offered or sponsored by third parties on the Better Platform, or electing to receive communications (such as emails or material by mail) or electing to participate in other programs (such as discount or rewards programs), offered or sponsored by third parties on the Better Platform, you consent to our providing your Personal Information to those third parties. Those third parties may use your Personal Information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your Personal Information by them.
				</p> 
				<p>We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (each a “Promotion”) through the Services that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, allowing the sponsor of the Promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion’s official rules, such as on a winners list.  
Information transmitted through boards, chats, and polls or through any other means remains in our databases and become the property of Better upon submission. Keep this in mind if you decide to communicate Personal Information through any of these applications.
				</p>
				<h2>How to Edit Your Information
				</h2>
				<p>Better provides you with the ability to access and edit your Personal Information. To update your Personal Information, click Settings in the Better menu.</p>  
				<p>We have established procedures to correct inaccurate information in a timely manner. If you have any reason to believe that Personal Information about you that is stored and maintained by us is incorrect, please contact us by email at: contact@organicparking.com.</p>  
				<h2>Your California Privacy Rights
				</h2>
				<p>California’s “Shine the Light” law, California Civil Code § 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers (those who have an established business relationship with us) asking about the business’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure (opt-in) or if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing (opt-out).</p> 
				<p>We have opted for this alternative approach, and we do not share personal information of customers with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes unless you provide us with permission at the time you provide such customer information.</p> 
				<h2>Protection of Personal Information
				</h2>
				<p>We strive to maintain the reliability, accuracy, completeness and currency of your Personal Information in our databases and to protect the privacy and security of our databases and the information we collect.  Any Personal Information that you provide to us will be stored on our computer network servers.  We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information. The security measures in place for the Better Platform and its servers aim to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of the information you provide to us.  No data transmission over the internet, mobile network, wireless transmission or electronic storage of information, however, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Please note that we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use the Better Platform and provide us with your information at your own risk.  If you have any questions or concerns regarding the security of your information, please email us at contact@organicparking.com.</p>  
				<h2>Business Transitions
				</h2>
				<p>In the event that Better goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another entity, or transfer of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information or Usage Information might be among the assets transferred.  You will not be notified in advance of any such change in ownership or control of your Personal Information or Usage Information.</p>
				<h2>Links to Other Websites
				</h2>

				<h2>Changes in Privacy Policy
				</h2>
				<p>We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time, so you should review it each time you access the Site.  If we change this Policy, we will post the revised Policy on the Better Platform.</p>  
				<h2>Transfer of Personal Information to the United States
				</h2>
				<p>The Better Platform is operated in the United States and intended for users located in the United States.  If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including Personal Information, will be transferred to, and processed, stored and used in the United States.  The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your Personal Information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States.  By using the Better Platform or providing us with any information, you consent to the transfer to, and processing, usage, sharing and storage of your information, including Personal Information, in the United States as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

				<h2>No Information Collected from Children
				</h2>
				<p>We are very concerned about the safety of children online.  We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13.  In the event that we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from any child absent the parental consent required by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), or as otherwise permitted by COPPA, we will dispose of that information in accordance with applicable law.  If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under the age of 13 has provided us with information without your consent, please contact us here contact@organicparking.com and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our files.</p>
				<h2>Choice/Opt-Out
				</h2>
				<p>Better provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor.
